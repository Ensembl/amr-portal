# How to use the Anti-microbial resistance portal

The antimicrobial resistance portal contains three main data resources

- **Phenotypic AMR** (AMR was determined experimentally and taken from
  CABBAGE antibiograms catalogue)
- **Genotype predicted AMR** (AMR was predicted computationally using
  Genotype data)
- **Phenotypic/genotype AMR** (AMR for which both phenotypic and genotypic
  data is available)

## How to explore the AMR data in the portal

You can explore the three antimicrobial resistance (AMR) data resources
by selecting 'Find data resources' on the home page.

This will take you by default to the Phenotypic AMR data resource and a
view of the antibiotics for which experimental anti-microbial resistance
data is available.

### How to choose an AMR data resource

To choose an alternative AMR data resource to the default Phenotypic AMR
data select either

- Genotype predicted AMR
or
- Phenotypic / genotype AMR

under the 'Data' heading in the left hand column, both are highlighted
in blue.

## How to use the AMR data resource

### Selecting AMR data for antibiotics

The AMR data resource selected will show a view of the antibiotics for
which anti-microbial resistance data is available by default.

To select antibiotics of interest:

- Select the check box one or more antibiotics of interest e.g.
  azithromycin was selected in the example shown below.

- You can scroll through available checkboxes by moving the horizontal
  scroll bar under the list of checkboxes to the right.

    for which experimental anti-microbial resistance data is available.

A table of results will be listed on the bottom half of the screen,
below the antibiotic table.

### How to filter the data

The additional ways each anti-microbial resistance data resource can be
filtered are listed alongside the 'Filter by' header at the top of the
antibiotic table.

Each of the three AMR data resources has a specific set of filters.

eg In the view shown below for Phenotypic AMR data can be further
filtered by:

- Species
- Genus
- Resistance phenotype
- AST standard
- Testing methods
- Collection year
- Country

  <figcaption>

    all filters available for the Phenotypic AMR data resource.

</figure>

Genotype predicted AMR antibiotic data can be filtered by:

- Species
- Genus
- AMR class

Phenotypic / genotype AMR antibiotic data can be filtered by:

- Species
- Genus
- Phenotype data - (select true to show phenotypic data)
- Genotype data (select true to show those with genotype data - select
  false to show those without genotype data )

To filter the data:

- Find a filter of interest alongside the "Filter by" header,
  highlighted in blue, ie Species.
- Select the filter ie Species Click on the check box alongside a
  species of interest to begin subsetting the data.
- You can scroll through available checkboxes by moving the horizontal
  scroll bar under the list of checkboxes to the right.
- You may continue to add any filter available for an AMR data resource
  by repeating this process.
- A reduced and more specific table of results will be displayed on the
  bottom half of the page as additional filters are added.
- If you swap to another AMR data resource, the filter criteria will
  change to fit the new resource.

## What can you find in the results table?

The results table displays all the available information for each data
point in the AMR data resource used.

The information displayed in the results table for each AMR data
resource is different.

For example the Phenotypic AMR resource results table displays:

- Antibiotic name
- Antibiotic abbreviation
- Resistance phenotype
- Measurement
- BioSample ID
- Assembly ID
- Genus
- Species
- Organism
- Host
- INSDC secondary accession
- Laboratory typing method
- Platform
- Ast standard
- Antibiotic ontology
- Collection year

Different information is displayed in the results table for 

- Genotype predicted AMR and 
- Phenotypic/genotype AMR.

The results table has many columns which are off screen and can be viewed by
moving the scroll bar on the bottom of the results table to the right.

The number of rows in the results table will depend on how you have
filtered the data.

### How to navigate the results table

- to **reveal all the columns** in the results table - move the scroll
  bar on the bottom of the results table to the right.

- To **reveal all the rows** in the table move the scroll bar on far right
  of the results table down.

### How to navigate the results table

- To **change the number of results** displayed per page by using the
  drop-down menu.

- To **clear your results** click on the blue recycle bin icon on the
  right hand side of the results table.

### How to download the results table

To **download the results** table

- select the download arrow on the right hand side of the results table.
