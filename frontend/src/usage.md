# Accessing AMR data resources

## Searching for AMR data on EMBL-EBI resources

AMR data at EMBL-EBI is deposited into [BioSamples](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples), our archive for biological samples used in research and development, and assembled isolate genomes into the [European Nucleotide Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena). Our [step by step guide will guide you through accessing AMR data from these repositories](/searching_amr_data).

## Exploring using the AMR portal website

The AMR portal is a user friendly fast query engine designed to allow for rapid filtering of AMR data. You can explore antimicrobial resistance data using the [Query AMR data portal link](/data/) at the top left of this page or on the home page. A [more in-depth guide to using the resource is available](/accessing_amr_data_via_portal).

## Data and programmatic access

Data is made available from our FTP site where you can find parquet and compressed CSV representations of our data alongside GFF and TSV reports from AMRFinderPlus. More details are available [from our developer resources](/developers).
