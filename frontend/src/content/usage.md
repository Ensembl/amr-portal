# How to use the Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) portal

The antimicrobial resistance (AMR) portal contains three main data resources

- **AMR phenotypes**  - AMR was determined experimentally including minimum inhibitory concentrations
- **AMR genotypes** - AMR genes and mutations were annotated computationally
- **Combined phenotypes and genotypes** - A cross join between phenotype and genotype data based on shared BioSample, assembly and antibiotic identity

## How to explore the AMR data in the portal

You can explore the three antimicrobial resistance (AMR) data resources
by selecting one of the links on the home page, e.g.: 'AMR phenotypes'.

    AMR phenotypes, AMR genotypes, and Combined phenotypes and genotypes.

</figure>

This will take you by default to the AMR phenotypes data and a
view of the antibiotics for which experimental antimicrobial resistance
data is available.

### How to choose an AMR data resource

To choose an alternative AMR data resource to the default AMR phenotypes
data select either

- _In silico_ AMR prediction
- Experimental and _In silico_ AMR

Under the 'Data' heading in the left hand column, both are highlighted in blue.

## How to use the AMR data resource

### Selecting AMR data for antibiotics

The AMR data resource selected will show a view of the antibiotics for
which antimicrobial resistance data is available by default.

To select antibiotics of interest:

- Select the check box one or more antibiotics of interest e.g.
  azithromycin was selected in the example shown below.
- You can scroll through available checkboxes by moving the horizontal
  scroll bar under the list of checkboxes to the right.

</figure>

A table of results will be shown on the bottom half of the screen,
below the antibiotic table.

### How to filter the data

The additional ways each antimicrobial resistance data resource can be
filtered are listed alongside the 'Filter by' header at the top of the
antibiotic table.

Each of the three AMR data resources has a specific set of filters.

e.g.: In the view shown below for AMR phenotypes the data can be further
filtered by:

- Species
- Genus
- Resistance phenotype
- Isolation source category
- Testing method
- Collection year
- Geographical subregion
- Country

  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

AMR genotypes data can be filtered by:

- Species
- Genus

Combined data can be filtered by:

- Species
- Genus
- Resistance Phenotype - (select true to show phenotypic data)
- Isolation source category  (select true to show those with genotype data - select
  false to show those without genotype data )  
- Testing method
- Collection year  
- Geographical subregion
- Country

To filter the data:

- Find a filter of interest alongside the \"Filter by\" header,
  highlighted in blue, i.e. Species.
- Select the filter i.e. Species, click on the check box alongside a
  species of interest to begin sub-setting the data.
- You can scroll through available checkboxes by moving the horizontal
  scroll bar under the list of checkboxes to the right.
- You may continue to add any filter available for an AMR data resource
  by repeating this process.
- A reduced and more specific table of results will be displayed on the
  bottom half of the page as additional filters are added.
- If you swap to another AMR data resource, the filter criteria will
  change to fit the new resource.

## What can you find in the results table?

The results table displays all the available information for each data
point in the AMR data resource used.

The information displayed in the results table for each AMR data
resource is different.

For example the AMR phenotypes resource results table displays:

- Antibiotic name
- Resistance phenotype
- Measurement
- Ast standard
- Laboratory typing method
- Platform
- BioSample ID
- Assembly ID
- Genus
- Species
- Organism
- Host
- INSDC secondary accession
- Antibiotic ontology
- Collection year
- Host age
- Isolate
- Isolation source
- Isolation latitude
- Isolation longitude
- AMR associated publications
- Updated phenotype CLSI
- Updated phenotype EUCAST
- Used ECOFF
- Source
- Country
- Geographical region
- Geographical subregion

Different information is displayed in the results table for

- AMR genotypes
- Combined phenotypes and genotypes

The results table has many columns which are off screen and can be viewed by
moving the scroll bar on the bottom of the results table to the right.

The number of rows in the results table will depend on how you have
filtered the data.

### How to navigate the results table

- To **reveal all the columns** in the results table - move the scroll
  bar on the bottom of the results table to the right.
- To **reveal all the rows** in the table move the scroll bar on far right
  of the results table down.

- To **change the number of results** displayed per page by using the
  drop-down menu.
