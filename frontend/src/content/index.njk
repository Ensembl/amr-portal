{% set cardLinkText1 %}
Query and filter antibiogram AMR records based on antibiotic,
resistance phenotype, species and other key attributes.
Contains over 1.5 million entries across 170,000 samples and 100,000 assemblies.
{% endset %}

{% set cardLinkText2 %}
Query and filter In silico predictions of AMR resistance from AMRFinderPlus.
Provides access to predictions and annotation for 40,000 genomes and samples.
{% endset %}

{% set cardLinkText3 %}
A merged dataset of experimental evidence and In silico predictions
of AMR resistance based on the prediction of AMR resistance
to the same compound in identical samples and assemblies.
{% endset %}

      <p>
        Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a major growing concern to public health
        predicted to cause over 2M deaths per year by 2050, with the Global South facing
        a disproportionate burden of AMR increasing the risk of untreatable bacterial infections.
      </p>

      <p>
        The AMR Portal is a collaboration between EMBL-EBI research and service teams
        alongside Imperial College London to deliver a new way to access and explore
        AMR phenotype and genotype annotations through a user-friendly interface.
        AMR antibiogram records can be filtered by an antibiotic compound, resistance phenotype,
        testing methods and many more attributes.
        The same data can be programmatically interrogated in a number of different programming languages.
      </p>

      <p>
        Data within the portal was produced by the MRC project CABBAGE
        (Comprehensive Assessment of Bacterial-Based AMR prediction from Genotypes).
        CABBAGE represents the largest public AMR dataset in a reconciled, uniform format.
